Still work in progress, some bugs noticed already that haven't been fixed (e.g. division doesn't work with second(or higher)-degree terms.
Not "cleaned up".
Note to self: make a type for polynomial!

Note to Elina: make suitable type(s) for terms as well. "Types" in plural because it could be beneficial to have separate types (inherited from a common base class) for constant terms and variable terms. And while we are on the subject of types, define one for a binary operation (i.e. an operation that takes exactly two operands) as well. But before considering any of this, study (binary) trees: what they are, how to construct one, how are they useful, various ways to traverse a tree structure just to give some suggestions. I put "binary" in parenthesis because binary tree is a special case of a tree data structure. As the name suggests, each node of a binary tree has at most two child nodes.
